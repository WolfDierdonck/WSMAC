# WSMAC
WSMAC is a revolutionary language teaching tool utilising the principles of classical conditioning to facilitate language acquisition and form useful habits. When deployed, WSMAC analyzes the speech behaviour of users and reminds them of improper grammar and/or pronunciation by use of the SLAP (Spontaneous Linguistic Abnormality Punisher).
